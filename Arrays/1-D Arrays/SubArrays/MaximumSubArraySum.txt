Given array you need to find maximum sub array sum


Brute: O(n^3)
Generate all sub arrays and find sum of each sub array and return maximum sum(in three loops)
SC: O(1)

Better: O(n^2)
Generate all sub arrays and find sum of each sub array and return maximum sum(in two loops)


Optimal: O(n)
Use kadane's algorithm


1. Start iterating in array, intialize sum and maxSum to 0
2. keep adding array elements to sum variable
3. if sum is greater than maxSum, update maxSum
4. if sum is less than 0, update sum to 0 but why? because if sum is less than 0, it will decrease the sum of next sub array
5. Whenever you are taking sum or adding, first add and then check if any condition is satisfied

FOLLOW UP QUESTION:
1. If you need to return the sub array as well, then you need to maintain two variables start and end
2. Whenever sum==0, you can update start=i, and when sum>maxSum, you can update end=i


Bonus: if in question, it says to return empty sub array as well, which means the maxSum>0, then you can just return maxSum as 0 and return empty array
