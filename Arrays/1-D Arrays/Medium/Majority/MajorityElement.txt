Find Majorit element who appears more than n/2 times



Brute: Apply linear search and count the number of times the element appears. If it appears more than n/2 times, return it. Else return -1.
Remember to use fresh count variable for each element. (mention count inside of outer for loop)
TC: O(n^2) SC: O(1)



Better: You can use the hashmap
TC:O(nlogn)+O(n): TC
SC: O(n)


Optimal: Moore's Voting Algorithm
TC: O(n) SC: O(1)

1. Start iterating in the array and maintain two variables, count and element.
2. If the current element is equal to the element variable, increment the count variable.
3. Else, decrement the count variable.
4. If the count variable becomes 0, update the element variable with the current element and reset the count variable to 1.
5. After the iteration, the element variable will have the majority element.
6. Iterate again in the array and count the number of times the element variable appears in the array. If it appears more than n/2 times, return it. Else return -1.
