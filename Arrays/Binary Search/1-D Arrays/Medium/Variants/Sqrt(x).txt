You are given a number n, you need to find the square root of it.
Only floor value is required.

if you are required to find double value of square root, you can use inbuilt function sqrt().
    
Example 1:

Input:
n = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: Square root of 5 is 2.236068.
The floor value of 2.236068 is 2.

Answer in floor value code:
Code to get floor value of square root of a number:

Brute force:
int ans=1;
Linear search from 1 to n, if i*i<=n, ans=i, else break;
for(int i=1; i<=n; i++){
    if(i*i<=n){
        ans=i;
    } else {
        break;
    }
}

Eventually low will be pointing to the right one and high one will be pointing to the maximum one, so at the end high will be the answer.

int floorSqrt(int n)
{
    // Write your code here.
    int low=1, high=n;
    while(low<=high){
        long long mid=(low+high)/2;
        long long square=mid*mid;
        if(square<=n){
            low=mid+1;
        } else {
          high = mid - 1;
        }
    }
    return high;
}
