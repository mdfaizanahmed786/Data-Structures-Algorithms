Search insert element
You are given a sorted array and a given number, if number exists in array return its index, if not return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.


It is just implementation of lower bound

int searchInsert(vector<int>& arr, int x)
{
	// Write your code here.
	int idx=arr.size();
	
	int low=0, high=arr.size()-1;
		while(low<=high){
int mid=low+(high-low)/2;
if(arr[mid]>=x){
	idx=mid;
	high=mid-1;

} else {
    low=mid+1;

}

		}


	return idx;
}
