You are given an sorted array, you need to find ceil and floor of a given number x. See below definitions.
1. Ceil of a number x is the smallest number in array greater than or equal to x.
2. Floor of a number x is the largest number in array smaller than or equal to x.
Note: If target is not found in the array, return -1, -1



pair<int, int> getFloorAndCeil(int arr[], int n, int x) {
	// Write your code here.
	sort(arr, arr+n);
	// Ceil is the smallest number greater than or equal to x
	// Floor is the largest number less than or equal to x 
	pair<int, int>p;
	p.first=-1;
	p.second=-1;
	int low=0, high=n-1;
	while(low<=high){
		int mid=(low+high)/2;
		if(arr[mid]>=x){
           p.second=arr[mid];
		   high=mid-1;

		}
		else{
			low=mid+1;
		}
	}

	low=0, high=n-1;
	while(low<=high){
		int mid=(low+high)/2;
		if(arr[mid]<=x){
			p.first=arr[mid];
			low=mid+1;
		}
		else{
			high=mid-1;
		}

	}

	return p;
	
}
