What is lower bound of an element?
It is the smallest element in the set that is greater than or equal to the given element.
If there is no such element, we just return the size of the array.
arr[index]>=n where index is the smallest one.

Code:

int low=0, high=n-1;

int idx=n;
while(low<=high){
int mid=low+(high-low)/2;
if(arr[mid]>=x){
    may be this is the answer
idx=mid;
but we will check if there is any other element which is smaller than this
high=mid-1;

} else {
low=mid+1;

}



}

return idx;

TC: O(logn)
SC: O(1)

STL: lower_bound(arr,arr+n,x)-arr;

int lowerElement=lower_bound(arr.begin(), arr.end(), x)-arr.begin();

for instance if you are need to find lower bound in this array from 2 to 6 : [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] then you need to write something like this in the array
lower_bound(arr.begin()+2, arr.begin()+7, x)-arr.begin();
