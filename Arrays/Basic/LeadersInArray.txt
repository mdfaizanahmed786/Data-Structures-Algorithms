Find leaders in an array

Explanation: This means the element is greater than all the elements to its right side. The rightmost element is always a leader.

Brute:
Always compare for an element to the right side of it. If it is greater than all the elements to its right side, then it is a leader.
  vector<int> result;
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
        bool flag=1;
            for(int j=i+1; j<n; j++){
                if(a[i]<a[j]){
                    flag=0;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if(flag) result.push_back(a[i]);
        }

TC: O(n^2)
SC: O(N)

IT IS ALSO FOR DUPLICATE ELEMENTS


Optimal: Start traversing from right side, and keep track of the maximum element. If the current element is greater than the maximum element, then it is a leader.

 int maxi=-1;
        for(int i=n-1; i>=0; i--){
            if(a[i]>=maxi){
               maxi=a[i];
                result.push_back(a[i]);
            }
          
        }
        
        reverse(result.begin(), result.end());

TC: O(n)
SC: O(N)
