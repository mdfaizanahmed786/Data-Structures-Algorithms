You are given a number N. You need to find no of trailing zeroes in N!.


Example:
5! = 120 so the output should be 1
10! = 3628800 so the output should be 2

Approach:
1. If you divide number with 5, it will give you number of 5s in the number.
2. If you divide number with 25, it will give you number of 25s in the number.
3. If you divide number with 125, it will give you number of 125s in the number.

So, you must repeat this process till n becomes 0.

(n/5)+(n/25)+(n/125)+.....

Code:
int count=0;
while(n>0){
    count+=n/5;
    n=n/5;
}

return count;

Time Complexity: O(logn)
