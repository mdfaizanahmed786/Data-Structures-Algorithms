Given two positive integers a and b, return the number of common factors of a and b.

An integer x is a common factor of a and b if x divides both a and b.


Algorithm:
1. Take minimum of them.
2. Iterate from 1 to min.
3. If both are divisible by i, then increment count.
4. Return count.

TC: O(min(a,b))
SC: O(1)
