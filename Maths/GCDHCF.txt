Find GCD or HCF of given two numbers


Brute: 

for(int i=min(a,b); i>=1; i--){
		if(a%i==0 && b%i==0) return i;
	}
    return 1;

TC: O(min(a,b))
SC: O(1)

We are starting from reverse because, we want to find the largest number which divides both a and b. So, we are starting from min(a,b) and going till 1.

Optimal:
Using Euclid's Algorithm

Algo: gcd(a,b)=gcd(a-b, b) a>b
gcd(a,b)=gcd(a, b-a) b>a

or 

gcd(a,b)=gcd(a%b, b) a>b
gcd(a,b)=gcd(a, b%a) b>a


if one of the number is 0, then return the other number.


while(a>0 && b>0){
		if(a>b) a=a%b;
		else b=b%a;

	}


if(a==0) return b;
else return a;
	

TC: O(log(min(a,b)))
Why log?
Because, in each iteration, we are reducing the value of a or b by atleast half.
and what is log base value?
it is phi, because we don't know whether a or b is greater, so we are taking the worst case, which is phi.
