Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie.

Each child i has a greed factor g[i], which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size s[j]. If s[j] >= g[i], we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.



Input: g = [1,2,3], s = [1,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3. 
And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.
You need to output 1.



sort(s.begin(), s.end());
sort(g.begin(), g.end());
        int i=0, j=0;
        while(i<g.size() && j<s.size()){
            if(s[j]>=g[i]){
                count++;
                i++;
                j++;
            }
          else{
              j++;
          }
        }

        return count;
